For example if someone entered 'red'. Then 'reddit.com', 'alfred.com', and 'redsite.com' would be excluded from word replacement. Similarly if someone entered 'reddit.com' then all reddit.com subdomains and domains would be excluded (for instance reddit.com/r/music and http://www.reddit.com/r/pics would be excluded). 'google.com/search' is disabled by default since this extension seems not to play nicely.</span></a></h2>
